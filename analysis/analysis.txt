Question 1: are the benchmark timings for StringStrand consistent 
with the explanation below that the time to execute cutAndSplice is O(b2S)?



Note that the value of b is half the number of
 calls to append since each cut (except the first) 
 is modeled by two calls of append in the method cutAndSplice -- see the code. 
 This means that b2 will be constant in the benchmark, but S will vary. 

Question 2: are the benchmark timings for StringBuilderStrand consistent 
with the explanation below that the time to execute cutAndSplice is O(bS)? 

Note that the value of b is half the number of calls to append since each 
cut (except the first) is modeled by two calls of append in the method cutAndSplice -- see the code. 
This means that b will be constant in the benchmark, but S will vary. 

Question 3: Explain why the time for LinkStrand does not change much at all over 
all the runs in the benchmark program. Explain why you think memory is exhausted 
at the specific strand size you see in your timings -- as compared to exhaustion for String and StringBuilder.

LinkStrand is O(1
